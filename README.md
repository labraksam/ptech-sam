# RelationshipGoals
RelationShip goals is a site for people with different lifegoals to meet up. Its possible to register, log-in and find matches that have the samen lifegoals. Its also possible to upload your own profile picture, be in a session and delete your account.

## How to install
To install this, you have to follow a few steps.

**Clone git**

* Open your terminal and do ```cd``` with the name of the folder where you want to place it in.
* Run the following code to clone it to the folder.

```
clone https://github.com/labraksam/be-assessment-2.git
```

**Install Mongodb**

To save all the data you have to install Mongodb

* First install Homebrew to help install Mongodb

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

then install Mongodb

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.0
```

* In another tab in your terminal, you have to make a database folder with the following code.

```
mongod --dbpath db
```

Go back to the previous tab, and make a mongo database. Use two different tables. A ```user``` and ```lifegoals```.
```
mongo
use relationshipgoals
db.runCommand( { create: "users" } )
db.runCommand( { create: "lifegoals" } )
```

* After creating it, you have to make sure the database is connected. ```cd``` to the main folder where you store the secret database info.
```
touch .env


DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PORT=27017
DB_NAME=relationshipgoals
SESSION_SECRET=secret_message
```

Install npm to go further

```
npm install
```

**Run the server**

To run the server, use nodemon. Use the following line in your terminal.
```
nodemon server/index.js
```
The website is now available at localhost:8080. Have a look!

## Tech I used
For the RelationshipGoals platform I used the following things

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is used to make the project in.

* [Body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) to help with the request from the forms.

* [Argon2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2) to safe my password in a hesh (more safety).

* [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) to upload an image in my form.

* [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) makes it easier to use the server.

* [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) the database to save data in.

## Final words
For me this was a tough course, but after all very interesting. In the beginning it was a lot of information that I didn't know what to do with. I like to work on something where you can see results. For me it was difficult to build something and see almost nothing change. After many more hours than expected, I was able to build what I wanted to build and finally saw some results. When this happened I was much more motivated to spend more hours on it and build the thing that I wanted to build. It is cool to see that I am building something that works, mainly because I started to think how I would do this. I have learned a lot from the theory, but especially the process itself.
